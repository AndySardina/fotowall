Fotowall 0.21 to 0.22
In this files, there is a summary of all the change made by Tanguy Arnaud

-> main.cpp -> replaced show() by showMaximized()

-> add slot on_addPictures_clicked which call the new function FWScene::loadPicures. 
	Now, you can also add Pictures whith the "Add pictures" button

-> add the checkbox "Picture border" to show/hide the rect around the Picture.
	It call the slot on_pictureBorderCheckbox_clicked wich set the global var drawPictureBorder   to true or false
	I add a test in the FWFoto::paint.
	FWButton::paint have also been modified : when drawPictureBorder is true, the button is at the corner of the picture's rect, when false, it's just   	 under the picture's corner.

-> FWScene::save and FWScene::restore heve also been modified to save if the pictures' border must or not be shown

-> add the checkbox "Best qualtity" to show the image like in the PNG render. 
	It call the slot on_qualiteCheckbox_clicked which change the global globalExportingFlag to true or false

->  I change the FWScene::drawForeground, line 197 to 200, because I doesn't want to have the color rect.

-> I've implemented the proportionnal resize : Ctrl + drag and drop on the resize button.
	I've modify the FWFoto::keyPressEvent function by adding the Ctrl key pressed test which set the bool m_CtrlKey to true.
	I've added FWFoto::keyReleaseEvent function which set the bool m_CtrlKey to false
	FWFoto::slotResize have also been modified by adding a test : if m_CtrlKey is true, then this slot call FWFoto::slotResizeProportional.
