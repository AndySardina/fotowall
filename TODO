Newest:
-> display on-screen selection for picture frame
-> perform rectangular image composition based on an input picture (color, pattern)
-> perform image distribution based on shapes or probability sampling (on a sprayed grayscale canvas)

-> add an overlay html help when going on the lower-left corner

Suggested by Contrast on kde-look's page:
-> maintain aspect ratio when resizing by using shift or control when resizing
-> add an "add image" dialog (have a quick way of adding photos)
-> rotate the pictures on their z-axis
-> add the "color changing stuff" to the picture themselves
-> set a background picture (push a button and the picture goes into background in place of the gradient!)
  -> AL: doppioclick su foto -> background, 2-click su background->foto

Suggested by Superstoned on kde-look's page:
-> support more fileformats (you could easily use some KDE infrastructure for that - would also improve the file dialog ;-)
-> bring a photo came to the top of the stack if you click it (and document the scroll-wheel)
-> r+r: would dump the two color things, just one like plasma applets have
-> r+r: use the plasma icon?
-> change the color of the photos (middle color changer?)
-> color changers: it'd be good if it was easier to find them (maybe just use buttons?). animations are cool, thoug...

Suggested by TeeAhr1 on kde-look's page:
-> custom fonts

Suggested by Al on his bed:
-> click left/right/top/bottom to mirror the photo on that axis (flippamento!)
-> checkbox con il "beginner mode" (solo per aiutare Al!)
-> use some matthias kretz's magic to make reflections

Suggested by David:
-> Altri tipi di bordo (francobollo, cuore, stella, ..)

Suggested by Timo via mail:
-> set the headers to GPLv2
