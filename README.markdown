FotoWall
========

FotoWall is a creative tool that allows you to layout your photos or pictures in a personal way. You can add pictures, then resize, move, change colors, text, shadows, etc.. 

Focus is on simplicity, express your creativity! ;-) 

Current Wishlist
----------------

This is the current list of requested features. If you have more of them, or any other idea, just press the "Issues" button and add your entry!! ;-) 

Special requests:

* more frame types (stamp, heart, star, ..) (David Eccher) 
* double-click on a picture -> set it as background, and vice-versa (Alberto Scarpa) 
* click left/right/top/bottom to mirror the photo on that axis (Alberto Scarpa) 
* checkbox for a "beginner mode" (Alberto Scarpa) 

Newest:

* add effects to photos 
* place the title everywhere 
* bring picture on top with a single click (setting always the highest z value to that picture) 
* display on-screen selection for picture frame 
* perform rectangular image composition based on an input picture (color, pattern) 
* perform image distribution based on shapes or probability sampling (on a sprayed grayscale canvas) 
* add an overlay html help when going on the lower-left corner 
* make reflections (dunno where.. just make them :D) 

Suggested by Contrast on kde-look's page: 

* maintain aspect ratio when resizing by using shift or control when resizing 
* add an "add image" dialog (have a quick way of adding photos) 
* rotate the pictures on their z-axis 
* add the "color changing stuff" to the picture themselves 
* set a background picture (push a button and the picture goes into background in place of the gradient!) 

Suggested by Superstoned on kde-look's page: 

* support more fileformats (you could easily use some KDE infrastructure for that would also improve the file dialog ;-) 
* bring a photo came to the top of the stack if you click it (and document the scroll-wheel) 
* r+r: would dump the two color things, just one like plasma applets have 
* r+r: use the plasma icon? 
* change the color of the photos (middle color changer?) 
* color changers: it'd be good if it was easier to find them (maybe just use buttons?). animations are cool, thoug... 

Suggested by TeeAhr1 on kde-look's page: 

* custom fonts
