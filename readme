*** Sharing Ideas ***

I hope to expand the program as soon as I can, since there is many room for
improvement and the code is kept clean and small.
- You can join the development.. the whole stuff is done with Qt 4.3 (planning
  to move to Qt 4.4 as soon as they're released officially) using the
  GraphicsView framework.
- And if you have any Idea or Suggestion, just drop me a line, on the project
  homepage or by mail at  enrico.ros@gmail.com ;-)


*** Building ***

This FotoWall packages provides source code; to make an executable out of the
sources you have to know a little about programming or ask one of your friends
to do it ;-) Or just grab an 'executable package' from the project homepage.

In Linux/X11, Mac, or Windows, install the latest Qt development packages that
you will find on http://www.trolltech.com:
 - on linux this is tested with Qt 4.3 and GCC 4.0+
 - on windows this is tested witn Qt 4.3 and MSVC Express 2005 and 2008
 - on mac this was not tested, report me if it simply works out of the box ;-)

Just open a command prompt (win), shell (linux, mac) and go the sources
location and issue the followings command
 - qmake
 - make   (or nmake, if your're on windows)
 
The executable will be build and you can start Enjoying FotoWall! ;-)
